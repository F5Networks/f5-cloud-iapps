## Introduction
This iApp is designed to provide logging into specific cloud analytics solutions (Azure OMS, AWS CloudWatch, etc.).  Additional instructions can be found within the iApp itself.

### Help
While this template has been created by F5 Networks, it currently is an **experimental** solution and therefore has not completed full testing and is subject to change.  F5 Networks does not offer technical support for solutions that have been deemed **experimental**.

We encourage you to use our [Slack channel](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com) for discussion and assistance on cloud related solutions.
